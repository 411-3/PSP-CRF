# PSP-CRF

This code is the implementation of my paper [Improving Semantic Image Segmentation with a Probabilistic Superpixel-based Dense Conditional Random Field](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8314143/), which named PSP-CRF. You can read the abstract of the paper to understand what I did quickly.
